**Urban Enigma**
------------
This is a docker container that will download software for people to
keep their private information private. The goal is to make the process
as simple as possible, so that it is available to everyone - even those
that may be technologically illiterate. Everyone deserves to be safe
and secure.
------------
My goal is to make the process simple and engaging. I will be handling
the front end. There will be a single HTML page that will load up from
the docker that will ask the user for their information and create an
encrypted cookie from that information that the main program will
use to begin downloading everything. Once this process begins, there
will be several UI elements. One will be a log of what is happening
on the backend, so that those curious users and people that do have
some knowledge will see what is going on. The other main UI component
will be to keep the user engaged: this will include small logic games
to keep the user preoccupied while the download and installs proceed.

Stretch #1:
- Begin a rudimentary website that:
    asks the user for their information
    creates a cookie for the backend to receive the information

Stretch #2:
- Complete the rudimentary webpage that:
    asks the user for their information
    creates an encrypted cookie
    displays the log of what the backend sends to be displayed
- Begin programming of a few logic games

Notes:
All goals of Stretch #1 were accomplished. I have a simple color scheme
and a few ideas on how to make the website more involved that have not
been implemented at all yet
