**Urban Enigma**
------------
This is a docker container that will download software for people to
keep their private information private. The goal is to make the process
as simple as possible, so that it is available to everyone - even those
that may be technologically illiterate. Everyone deserves to be safe
and secure.
------------
My job is to work on the UI and to make the process simple and engaging. 
There will be a single HTML page that will load up from
the docker that will ask the user for their information and create a
 cookie from that information that the main program will
use to begin downloading everything. Once this process begins, there
will be several UI elements. One will be a log of what is happening
on the backend, so that those curious users and people that do have
some knowledge will see what is going on. The other main UI component
will be to keep the user engaged: this will include small logic games
to keep the user preoccupied while the download and installs proceed.

Stretch #1:
- Write the abstract
- Begin a rudimentary website that:
    asks the user for their information
    creates a cookie for the backend to receive the information

Stretch #2:
- Meet up a few times with group
- Complete the rudimentary webpage that:
   - asks the user for their information
   - displays the log of what the backend sends to be displayed
- ~~Begin programming of a few logic games~~ Cam is working on these

Stretch #3:
- Finish the tie in with the games to the main index.html
- Clean up index.html, update page to display game graphics more clearly
- Add text effects to alerts from the backend so that they appear
  with to be typed in, similar to the main page.

Final Push:
- Work on poster
    - Complete the "Why this is needed" portion, with graphics
    - Begin details on what actually goes into the project
    - Mesh everything together from Greg, Cam, and Jacob
- Added back button for the games, so that the html page the user is on 
  does not need to be refreshed. 
- Record 'Elevator Pitch'
- Update the group's final readme.md

**Notes:**

11/5/2019
> All goals of Stretch #1 were accomplished. I have a simple color scheme
and a few ideas on how to make the website more involved that have not
been implemented at all yet

11/19/2019
> Added the games Cam worked on to the main page, but I didn't complete 
the log to show the user what's happening in the backend, nor did I encrypt 
the cookie. Moving alert system to Stretch #3, removing encryption of the 
cookie out of the project, because I'm currently not sure that's needed.

12/03/2019
> Realistically, not as much got done on the UI as I would have liked to. 
While it functions, it's not really how I saw it envisioned. It still 
displays the alerts from the console to the frontend and has games that 
users can flip back and forth between, but it isn't nearly as informative 
as I would have liked. Have a little bit more to complete for the group, 
like with the elevator pitch, the group's readme.md for the final version, 
and with making sure the alerts come in correctly.
