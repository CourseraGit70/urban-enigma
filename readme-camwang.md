**Urban Enigma**
------------
This is a docker container that will download software for people to
keep their private information private. The goal is to make the process
as simple as possible, so that it is available to everyone - even those
that may be technologically illiterate. Everyone deserves to be safe
and secure.
------------
For this project I am working on the frontend with Megan. The idea is to create a HTML page that loads from the docker container and gathers information to pass to the backend.
The general process of the backend is quite lengthy so the page should be updating the user on the progress, and create engaging "fidget" games on the webpage to keep the user interested.


Stretch #1:
- Begin a simple website using node
- Start looking into and setting up Heroku for emails

Stretch #2:
- Combine work with Megan on frontend and have the webpage implemented in Node.js
- Have the Heroku server running

Notes:
All goals of Stretch #1 were accomplished. I have a Heroku account and have begun looking at using Heroku for SMTP. I also setup a Node.js webpage that is a basic Hello World! for now
