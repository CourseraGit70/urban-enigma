**Urban Enigma**
------------
This is a docker container that will download software for people to
keep their private information private. The goal is to make the process
as simple as possible, so that it is available to everyone - even those
that may be technologically illiterate. Everyone deserves to be safe
and secure.
------------
My goal for this project is to test the frontend and backend at each new revision in docker. Once the code is tested, 
I will either consult l
sMegan and Cam (frontend) or Greg (backend). 

Stretch #1:
- Test the first impelemtations of the frontend and backend
  in docker and report any issues. 

Stretch #2:
- Continue to test the frontend and backend and report
  the issues.
  
Strech #3:
- Begin to test the ovpn implementation in docker and figure out how to change the .ovpn config file

Notes:
The backend has been tested in docker and issues have been reported.
