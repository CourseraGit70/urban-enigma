------------
This is a docker container that will download software for people to
keep their private information private. The goal is to make the process
as simple as possible, so that it is available to everyone - even those
that may be technologically illiterate. Everyone deserves to be safe
and secure.
------------

To run:
Execute docker_server.sh. 
Execute docker client setup. 
You will need to manually update the container names (for now) and manually transfer the server key.
